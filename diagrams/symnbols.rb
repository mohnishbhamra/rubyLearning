# Symbols are often used to refer to method names in reflective code. For example,
# suppose we want to know if some object has an each method:
p o.respond_to? :each
# Hereâ€™s another example. It tests whether a given object responds to a specified method,
# and, if so, invokes that method:
name = :size
if o.respond_to? name
p o.send(name)
