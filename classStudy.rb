#eql? is strict compare like ===
p 1 == 1.0 # true: Fixnum and Float objects can be ==
p 1.eql?(1.0) # false: but they are never eql!

#The === operator , moreover case equality
p 1 === 1.0 # and === is not strict like eql?
(1..10) === 5 # true: 5 is in the range 1..10

#Object Order operator <=>
1 <=> 5 # -1
5 <=> 5 # 0
9 <=> 5 # 1
"1" <=> 5 # nil: integers and strings are not comparable
